# Meeting Minutes 3/16/23

## Attendees
Chris, Alex, Jehan

## Agenda
Try to figure out Protege and work on axioms.

## Notes / Comments
- Alex spins up the markdown template for axioms provided in Pilot
- Everyone get Protege spun up
- Jehan uses CoModeIDE to make (most of) our schema diagram in Protege 
- Has everything except PotentialObstacle stuff
- Starts figuring out how to make domains and ranges of properties (that's some of the axioms)
- Chris works on figuring out how to use General Object Axioms to enter in "weird" axioms 
- It still errors out but maybe we'll figure it out 
- Also figures out how to do the export

## Action Items
- Jehan: Send everyone the Protege file he created 
- Chris: Maybe add a new stub pattern where appropriate? (the "Time" in Env shold be stub in case we only know that it's "daytime" and care about that)
- Chris: Work on sorting some of the "axioms" from "rules" in our already-written axioms 
- Alex: Figure out Manchester syntax to start translating some of those
