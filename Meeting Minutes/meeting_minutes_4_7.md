## Agenda

## Notes / Comments
 - Discover SPARQL aggregators--COUNT, AVG, etc--work in Apache
	- Useful for several competency questions 
 - Temptation to nest queries is strong
 - Jehan figures out how to count avg cars/scenario without it though
 - Chris finally adds the bridge that freezes when wet
 - Alex volunteers to present modules
 - That puts Jehan in the back third with competency questions + his queries
