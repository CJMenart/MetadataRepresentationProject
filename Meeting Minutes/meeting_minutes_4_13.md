# Meeting Minutes 4/13/23

## Attendees
Chris, Alex, Jehan

## Agenda
 - Create queries based on competency questions (5 remaining)
 - Complete documentation and validation

## Notes / Comments
 - Worked on complex query for "In which scenarios can the car merge to the right and/or left?" competency question
 - Updated schema to include speed for self-car
   - We will be using this in a competency question
 - Started making drafts of other queries but have not tested them
 - Decided to remove the competency question "Does the car have permission to turn right at the intersection?" because we believe it will become too complex
 - Started attempting to copy the results from server queries to validation.md

## Action Items
- Practice assigned slides for presentation
  - Time yourself so we can contain our total group time within 25 minutes
- Do we want to meet this weekend to practice presentation in-person?
