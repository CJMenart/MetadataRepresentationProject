Provided the instances of the dataset.
Axioms were clearly stated and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
It is unclear how the 2 different types of information correlate to each other.
Has a value for fatalities that shows whether there was a fatality, but does not show the amount of fatalities. Should be a boolean?
PlaneID relates to Plane, but PlaneModel is a subclass of plane. Does a PlaneModel have exactly one planeID?
