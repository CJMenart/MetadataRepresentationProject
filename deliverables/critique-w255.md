# Critique Assignment

## Group 3: (Airplanes)
**Members:** Erin, Sydney, Antrea
### Summary
The goal of their ontology was to include as much information as possible regarding airplanes of any kind. This included plane models, crashes, etc.

### Strengths
- Attributes of each aircraft were well-explained
- Including crash type information using integer values is efficient and still gets the point across
- Used string as a literal in query using ?"string" which I did not know you could do

### Weaknesses
- Very little comprehensive data on aircrafts is accessible online (most documentation is done on scanned copies/paper)
- Schema graphs are not very neat and does not always follow the correct shapes or color-coding for xsd primitives and classes
- Went through the queries and results pretty quickly and was a little harder to follow along
- Plane Model is its own class instead of being an attribute of a Plane

## Group 2: SOL of Life
**Members:** Brandon, Ryan, Megan
### Summary
Limited resources on Earth have created the need to explore asteroids in the solar system for additional resources. This knowledge graph aims to support missions of space exploration, research, and evacuation.

### Strengths
- Focused on our solar system to reduce the massive amount of space data (and because mining in other solar systems is implausible)
- Queries used advanced (at least advanced to me) key words such as BIND and filtered by name and distance

### Weaknesses
- Used Elemental Composition instead of MineralComposition when for Asteroid Classification (Mineral Composition is more accurate for what they were looking for).
- Data results split into quantity, quantity value, and quantity type were a little confusing.
- Limitations to data able to grab from the internet (Restricted to Lowell Observatory).
- Infrared scanning cannot calculate the exact amounts of elements/minerals in an asteroid.
